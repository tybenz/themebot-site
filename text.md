ThemeBot 
A fully configurable theming application for any CSS framework 

How does it work? 
ThemeBot allow you to easily create a user-friendly theming application that 
allows your users to customize the theme of any CSS framework. This opens the
door for bootstrapping new looks within the same framework. Users can count on
your theming app to quickly skin their new projects and hit the ground
running, and the best part is that ThemeBot requires virtually no extra
development time on your part. So you can provide your users with what
they want, without having to re-invent the wheel.


Why?
Developers interacting with CSS frameworks need a quick way to customize
the look and feel of their new app. ThemeBot provides developers what
they need to quickly implement an application specifically configured to
their frameworks

How?
ThemeBot provides some basic UI controls common among theming
application so users can preview what their theme looks like as they go.
It also provides the necessary CSS parsing to provide valid, minified
and compressed CSS that are production-ready

Features
Color picker - fully customizable
Number spinners - Can't live without them in an app that tweaks pixels
and ems
Slider - thrown in for good measure - can be tied to any numerical input
Draggable colors - Key piece of UI for quick color allocation
Combobox - customized to specific CSS property value-lists or Font
Family lists built by developer or tapped into some free font service

Possibilities
ThemeBot was designed for use with large-scale CSS frameworks. But who
says it has to be built for multiple users? How about just one? Your
client. ThemeBot works great for client work. A couple extra minutes
generating some LESS, and a few lines of JS, and your clients can skin
their own site to their hearts content

Demo
See an example of ThemeBot at work. I'm using the CSS framework Skeleton
applied to a simple blog site. Quickly theme our
demo blog site to get an idea of what ThemeBot can do!
